My name is Charlotte and I am a first-year PhD student in Political Behavior at the Department of Government at LSE. I did my Bachelor and Master at Humboldt University in Social Science and another MSc in Applied Social Data Science from LSE.  In my free time I love to cook, going to concerts (from Taylor Swift to Black Sabbath) and reading fiction.
