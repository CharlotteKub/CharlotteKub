## Hi âœ¨


My name is Charlotte and I am a first-year PhD student in Political Behavior at the Department of Government at LSE. I did my Bachelor and Master at Humboldt University in Social Science and another MSc in Applied Social Data Science from LSE.  In my free time I love to cook, going to concerts (from Taylor Swift to Black Sabbath) and reading fiction.

## âš¡ Research Interests

- Contextual Political Behavior
- Urban-Rural Divide
- Place-based identities
- Regional Inequality
- Green Transformation
- Computational Social Science

In my thesis,  I aim to explore how individuals' local environments influence political behavior, using micro-level geospatial data to disentangle the material impacts of rising regional inequality and the unique social identities shaped by the spatial divide between urban and rural citizens.
